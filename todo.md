# DeFi Arbitrage Multi-Agent System Development

## Requirements Gathering
- [x] Identify target DEXs (Uniswap, Curve, QuickSwap, ParaSwap, KyberSwap, Velodrome, Aerodrome)
- [x] Determine blockchain networks (Polygon, Base, Optimism, BSC, Arbitrum, Sonic)
- [x] Select market data sources (Coingecko/GeckoTerminal, CoinMarketCap, The Graph, Chainlink oracles)
- [x] Choose ML models (DistilBERT for Admin and DeFi Agents, Stable Baselines3 for RL)
- [x] Define token pair strategy (dynamic identification with min 100k liquidity)
- [x] Set risk parameters (min 0.5% profit after all fees)
- [x] Determine UI requirements (minimal interface)
- [x] Plan for Coinbase onchain agent SDK integration
- [x] Define flashloan strategy (dynamic optimization)
